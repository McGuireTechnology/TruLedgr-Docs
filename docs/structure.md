# Project Structure

TruLedgr is organized into several repositories, each with a specific purpose:

- **TruLedgr-API**: Backend API built with FastAPI.
- **TruLedgr-Docs**: Documentation for the entire TruLedgr ecosystem (this repo).
- **TruLedgr-App**: Desktop or mobile application (details in its README).
- **TruLedgr-Web**: Web frontend for TruLedgr.

Each repository contains its own setup and development instructions.
