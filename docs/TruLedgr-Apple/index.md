## FinanceKit

[Apple Developer FinanceKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/financekit)

To access someoneâ€™s financial data, you must meet the criteria outlined in Get started with FinanceKit:
- Request the FinanceKit managed entitlement
- Hold an organization-level Apple Developer account
- Be logged in as Account Holder
- Include the NSFinancialDataDescription string in your Info.plist

Apple reviews each application using defined criteria. If your request meets the criteria, Apple adds the entitlement to your developer account by using managed capabilities. To request access, see the FinanceKit managed entitlement request form. For more information about managed entitlements, see Provisioning with capabilities.
